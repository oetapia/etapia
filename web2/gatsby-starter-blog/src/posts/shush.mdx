Shush curbs abuse in communications by detecting language that can cause harm. It aims to increase diversity online and protect minorities, women and kids. 

## Product Management
In charge of product concept, product management and product launch.

### Market Research
While researching the gaming industry a problem kept coming up in many reports: Toxicity. 

To develop our solution we spoke with companies (from small to market leaders) in the gaming industry through referrals, events and cold contacts. 

Along with a team comprised of NLU and ML engineers and using existing open source technology we created: Shush CM.

### Shush CM
I project managed the dev team while the solution went through various stages: 

` concept| test case (local )| test case (cloud) | API + front-end | alpha `

### Integrations
Shush CM has a discord integration that sends information to the API. 

The meta data from the recording is displayed in a JAMStack front-end which I developed using reactJS.

I also developed two integrations for Zendesk: 
* As an API call from the front-end
* As a packaged Zendesk app using Javascript
