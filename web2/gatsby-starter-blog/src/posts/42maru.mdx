## 0. Prior

The OBD (Overseas Business Development) team was tasked with demand generation for the NLU search engine that the company was developing. 

As a newly created team, documentation, processes and material was not available. 

#### Branding

Esteban co-created marketing material for the team based on the extensive and complex technical ad-hoc specifications sold to local Chaebol companies. 

To simplify the offering, all projects were categorized under three core families: *enterprise*, *chatbot* and *smart devices*. With these all Korean content was translated to English and simplified as downloadable use cases. 

#### Website

To house all the new content and reduce the introductory PPT, a new website was created. Aligning with the core tech of the company Python was used. The stack included Django and Wagtail CMS implemented over two months. The custom set up was flexible and easy to manage by non tech members.  

The changes also improved SEO results with better content, keywords and metrics, doubling daily visits to website within 3 months, multiplied by 10x web presence and, created a tiered funnel using Hubspot.
