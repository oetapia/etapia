## Marketing
I joined Tecsisa as a graphic designer, became a digital marketer and eventually their core marketing staff managing a small team. We updated the logo, redesigned the brand, website, photographed staff and organized internal events. 


## UI/UX & Product
During my time in Tecsisa I learned best development practices (including agile), UI/UX, and HTML/CSS programming. I handled the front end development of various projects and participated in the product concept for a solution in the energy sector.
