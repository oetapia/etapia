## 1. Research and Strategy

Analyzing the market conditions of Germany and the trends within European investment showed movement within digital healthcare. In this space, there's three types of startups: those that heal (outcome focused), those that support therapists (medically focused), those that change processes (technological focus).

A large underserved market was found amid physiotherapy professionals. Whose work is highly stressful and increasing documentation demands interrupt their day to day.  

An opportunity to create a solution that simplifies this process via wearables and software integration was conceived.  To develop the solution we spoke with therapists in different cities of Germany, Spain and India.
